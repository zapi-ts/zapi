# Contributing to Nevr ⚡
---

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Nevr! By helping us, you are helping build a future where developers **never** have to write repetitive boilerplate again.



## 🌟 Our Philosophy
---

Nevr is designed to solve the **6 Backend Nightmares**. We believe:
1. **Best practices belong in the system**, not just in a Senior's head.
2. **Type-safety is non-negotiable.**
3. **The Plugin System is the heart.** If a feature is complex, it should be a plugin.

##  🌈 Contribution Guidelines
---

When contributing to Nevr, please keep the following guidelines in mind:

- Keep changes focused. Large PRs are harder to review and unlikely to be accepted. We recommend opening an issue and discussing it with us first.
- Ensure all code is type-safe and takes full advantage of TypeScript features.
- Write clear, self-explanatory code. Use comments only when truly necessary.
- Maintain a consistent and predictable API across all supported frameworks.
- Follow the existing code style and conventions.
- We aim for stability, so avoid changes that would require users to run a migration or update their config...

9. **Run the documentation locally**: To view and edit the documentation, you can run:
   ```bash
    pnpm -F docs dev
    ```
## 🚀 Contributing Workflow

    **Branch types prefix**:
    - `feat/` - New features
    - `fix/` - Bug fixes
    - `docs/` - Documentation updates
    - `chore/` - Maintenance tasks
    - `refactor/` - Code restructuring without changing functionality
    - `test/` - Adding or updating tests

2. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes in the appropriate files.

3. **Run Tests**: Before committing, ensure all tests pass.
   ```bash
    # Run all tests
        pnpm test

    # Run tests for a specific package
        pnpm -F "{package_name}" test
    ```
4. **Commit Changes**: Commit your changes with a descriptive message.
   ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "type: brief description of changes"
    # Example: git commit -m "feat: add new auth plugin"
    ```
5. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to your forked repository.
   ```bash
    git push origin type/description-of-feature
